# ctf-tables

## Hi and welcome! (:

We all like playing CTFs from different different platforms, right? Yes, we do! Platforms like [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com), [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com/), [VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com/) play key role in one's learning. There are thousands, if not hundreds of CTF challenges out there combinely on these platforms. I actively play CTFs on TryHackMe more than any platforms because I feel like I'm always at home, learning something everytime. Also there are other platforms that I have to play CTFs on, but for me, as of my personal opinion, TryHackMe is my love. In this repository, I have made a table, containing solved challenges from **TryHackMe**, **HackTheBox**, **Vulnhub** with their challenge links and their corresponding walkthroughs, differentiated by their difficulty level. I will be updating it constantly. Thankyou. 

**Please Note: I won't publish writeups of rooms like subscriber and walkthrough rooms which contains direct answer or those writeups which have direct copy paste theoretical portion from TryHackMe because this shall count in plagiarism. Although, I will add those writeups in which obfuscated information like (passwords/hashes/flags) are hidden and direct answer to questions are not included.**

***tl:dr, only those writeups will be accepted which have obfuscated the information like password/hashes/flags and direct answers to questions are not included.***

Here is the table which will take you to your desired box writeup. (:
