# CTF-Walkthroughs

## Hi and Welcome! (:

We all like playing CTFs from different different platforms, right? Yes, we do! Platforms like TryHackMe, HackTheBox, VulnHub play key role in one's learning. There are thousands, if not hundreds of CTF challenges out there combinely on these platforms. I actively play CTFs on TryHackMe more than any platforms because I feel like I'm always at home, learning something everytime. Also there are other platforms that I have to play CTFs on, but for me, as of my personal opinion, TryHackMe is my love. In this repository, I have made a table, containing solved challenges from **TryHackMe**, **HackTheBox**, **Vulnhub** with their challenge links and their corresponding walkthroughs, differentiated by their difficulty level. I will be updating it frequently. Thankyou. 

**Note: I won't publish writeups of some rooms like subscriber rooms and walkthrough rooms (as generally they contain answers) from TryHackMe don't have walkthrough because it counts in plagiarized content. But, I will be mentioning those rooms (subscriber and walkthrough rooms) links (without their writeups) so you can just navigate to that link and start learning!**

> If you want to collaborate or want your writeup to be in the table, shoot your writeup link on my discord handle **Hellfire#3915**.
