# Ctf-Matrix

## Hi and welcome! (:

We all like playing CTFs from different platforms, right? Yes, we do! Platforms like [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com), [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com/), [VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com/), [OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/), [RootMe](https://www.root-me.org/?lang=en), [Port Swigger](https://portswigger.net/web-security), [LetsDefend](https://letsdefend.io/), [Blue Team Labs Online](https://blueteamlabs.online/login), etcetera plays key role in one's learning. There are thousands, if not hundreds of CTF challenges combined on these platforms. I love playing CTFs on various platforms as these immensely help me gain new skills and polish the existing ones. This repository contains a matrix I created that contains solved challenges from **TryHackMe**, **HackTheBox**, and **Vulnhub** with their challenge links and corresponding walkthroughs, differentiated by their difficulty level. More writeups from other platforms will be added soon.

**Please Note: I won't publish writeups of rooms like subscriber and walkthrough rooms that contain a direct answer or those writeups which have a direct copy-paste theoretical portion from TryHackMe because this shall count as plagiarism. I will only add those writeups in which obfuscated information like, (passwords/hashes/flags) are hidden with direct answers to questions are not included.**

> ***tl:dr, only those writeups will be added which have obfuscated the information like password/hashes/flags, and direct answers to questions are not included.***
